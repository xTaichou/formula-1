Formula 1 analysis


The basis of the project was to create a race prediction model. Which is yet to be done. But the idea would be to build a model where I could train a model based on historic data and then take it a step further by predicting a winner after 70-80% of the laps a specific race. The world of Formula 1 is very complex with a lot of moving parts and as with any sports, anything can happen at anytime. Such is the randomness of the world we live in. I would therefore build the model based on a very simple data set such as lap times, race wins, historic performance of a driver/constructor at particular circuits. For me at my current level the, idea was very ambitious but allowed me to learn a lot in the space that I am interested in.

But it was also mainly for me to learn python analytic tools. I have used python a lot for basic programming and to learn structures (during university) but not for anything related to data analytics/science. I want to improve both my programmig and analyitcal skills. I have a lot to learn in this space but I am very keen to see where it takes me. I therefore started off where I was comfortable which was excel and used pivots and charts to understand the data better and get an idea of what I wanted to try produce using tools such as matplotlib and seaborn for example. From there is was where every developer goes which was Stack Overflow and YouTube tutorials.

Please note that this project is in progress and still requires a lot work until I would consider it finished.

Some general notes:
Data was aquired from Kaggle, but the data is constantly being updated so it might not match what I have in my repository. Link for the dataset is below.

All excel anaylsis was done by me.
All code was done from scratch and I make use of PyCharm as my IDE of choice.
